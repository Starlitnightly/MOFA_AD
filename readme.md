## Abstract

Cell differentiation in human tissues is influenced by the microenvironment in which cells adapt to the corresponding biological processes. Here, we integrate multi-omics single-nucleus data in the cortex of patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease, and constructed a novel pipeline to explore the source of cell differentiation and the regulatory mechanism of the heterogeneity. In our study, we identified heterogeneity factors of cortex between normal person and Alzheimer’s patient, and figured out the the activation and inactivation feature underlying the cell differentiation. Besides, we explored the mechanism of adapting to Alzheimer’s disease microenvironment by pseudotime analysis in astrocytes and microglia and oligodendrocyte. We describe the reasons for the heterogeneity of cells in Patients with Alzheimer's disease from a prior probability perspective, and this study provides a new perspective for precision medicine targeting different cells in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
